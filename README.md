# PWstrongbox
PWstrongbox is a simple software application that consists of encrypting and storing sensitive data such as Username, Email and Password of different sites you register to and afterwards you don't want to have to remember your data. When you need to login to any site just open PWstrongbox and it will remember the data from how it was entered last time! When you close the application all the encrypted data will be saved to a file and to have access to it you will need to have the appropriate key which is PWstrongbox's unique password, basically with one password you remember them all! (like a Password Manager).

For this personal project as Graphical User Interface I used Java Swing and for encryption algorithm I used AES 256.

# How to use

By downloading the program already compiled from releases github section:

Start PWstrongbox.exe, the **default password is 1234** but you can change it with the button "Edit PW" top-right corner in the window after login.
Each new site (URL) and Account (ACC) can be added (+), removed (-) using the related buttons. Plus Accounts can also be updated should saved data change.

Here is an example to understand how it works:

NOTE: remember that for the proper functioning of PWstrongbox it is necessary for JRE to be present in the environment of your operative system.
